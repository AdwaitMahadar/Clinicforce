## What This Project Is

**Clinicforce** is a multi-tenant SaaS **Clinic Management System (CMS)** for small healthcare practices. It is **staff-only** — no patient portal. The app centralizes patient records, appointment scheduling, and document management, replacing paper-based workflows.

**Scope constraints (MVP):**
- No patient self-service or external-facing portal
- No automated booking or patient notifications
- No prescription/report generation (documents are uploaded, not generated)
- Medicines module is a reference library only (future automation hook)

**`components/common/` inventory (what's built):**
- `DataTable.tsx` — TanStack Table v8, server-side mode, with skeleton loading
- `TableFilterBar.tsx` — Notion-style collapsible filter panel with column/value selectors
- `TablePagination.tsx` — Reusable pagination footer
- `StatusBadge.tsx` — Unified badge for appointment status, patient status, types, chart IDs
- `InitialsBadge.tsx` — Deterministic initials avatar (hashed colour from ID)
- `AppointmentEventCard.tsx` — FullCalendar custom event renderer
- `MonthView.tsx` — Custom two-panel month layout for appointments
- `TimeGridView.tsx` — FullCalendar timeGridWeek/timeGridDay wrapper
- `StatCard.tsx` — Metric summary card
- `EventLog.tsx` — Activity/audit log list component
- `DetailForm.tsx` — RHF + Zod field-driven form: required `fields` array (single scrollable 2-column grid); `forwardRef` + `DetailFormHandle` (`submit` / `reset`); Radix `<Select>` is controlled (`value` + remount `key`). No footer — parent uses `DetailPanel` or composes actions.
- `DetailPanel.tsx` — Shell for detail modals/pages: header, scrollable form slot, optional `DetailSidebar` (tabbed zone + activity log), footer (Save / Cancel / optional delete via `formRef.submit()`).
- `DetailSidebar.tsx` — Right column: optional `sidebarTabs` + `events` (activity log) in a fixed bottom zone.
- `ModalShell.tsx` — Intercepting modal wrapper component
- `DocumentMimeTypeIcon.tsx` — PDF / image / generic file icon from MIME (shared with `DocumentCard`, `UniversalSearch`)
- `DocumentCard.tsx` — Document row; opens presigned GET in a new tab
- `UniversalSearch.tsx` — Dialog + cmdk command palette; debounced `searchGlobal`, grouped results, document presigned open vs `router.push` for entities (wired from `TopNav`, ⌘/Ctrl+K)
- `UploadDocumentDialog.tsx` — Presigned PUT upload + `confirmDocumentUpload` metadata
- `skeletons/` — Route `loading.tsx` building blocks (`PageHeaderSkeleton`, `TableDashboardSkeleton`, `HomeDashboardSkeleton`, `CalendarDashboardSkeleton`, `ReportsPlaceholderSkeleton`, `DetailPageSkeleton`, `ModalDetailSkeleton`)

## Navigation Model

Two-axis matrix: **top navbar** (entity/domain) × **left sidebar** (view within domain).

- **Top nav:** Home | Appointments | Patients | Medicines
- **Side nav:** Dashboard | Reports
- **Active state:** Driven by `usePathname()` — never managed manually
- **Active item rule:** Only the active top-nav item shows its label; inactive items show icon only

Routes follow `/{entity}/{view}` — all static segments. Root `/` redirects to `/home/dashboard`.

Detail records open as **intercepting route modals** (`@modal` parallel routes). Every entity also has a full-page fallback for direct URL / refresh access.

Patient and medicine **dashboard** tables pass **`onRowClick`** to `<DataTable />` so a row navigates to `/patients/view/[id]` or `/medicines/view/[id]` (soft navigation opens the modal). Entity **detail/create** flows use **`DetailPanel`** + **`DetailForm`**; Save / Cancel sit in the **panel footer** (submit via `formRef`). After `createPatient` (and similar) succeeds, the modal **closes** (`router.back()` + `router.refresh()`), or the full-page new route **pushes to** `/patients/dashboard` — list refreshed via `revalidatePath` + refresh.

**CRITICAL — `/view/[id]` routing pattern:** Detail routes MUST use `/view/[id]` (e.g. `/appointments/view/abc-123`), never a bare `/[id]` (e.g. `/appointments/abc-123`). A bare `[id]` is a dynamic segment that matches ANY string — including `dashboard`, `new`, and `reports` — causing the `@modal` interceptor to match nav-bar clicks and freeze the page. The `/view/` sub-segment creates a separate namespace that can never conflict with static nav segments.

## Core Business Rules & Constraints

### Multi-Tenancy
- Every DB table has a `clinic_id` foreign key — **every query must filter by `clinicId`**
- `clinicId` is resolved server-side from the session — never passed from the client
- `clinicId` is never exposed in URLs or client state

### Identification
- Never show raw UUIDs in the UI — use `chartId` only
- `chartId` is unique per entity per clinic

### RBAC
- Three roles: `admin` | `doctor` | `staff`
- UI hiding is for UX only — all server actions must enforce role checks independently
- See `docs/01-PRD.md` for the full permission matrix

### Appointments
- Status enum: `scheduled | completed | cancelled | no-show`
- Type enum: `general | follow-up | emergency`
- Tracks scheduled start as `scheduled_at` (single timestamp), optional actual visit time (`actual_check_in` — UI time-only, server uses server calendar day), and `duration` (minutes)

### Documents
- Can attach to a patient or a user, optionally linked to an appointment
- Stored via S3 presigned URLs — metadata in DB, file in object storage

---

## UI Rules (Non-Negotiable)

- **All colours via CSS variables** — no hardcoded hex values anywhere in components. Variables defined in `app/globals.css`
- **Typography:** DM Serif Display for `<h1>` page titles only; DM Sans for everything else
- **`<PageHeader />`** at the top of every page — no one-off headers
- **Main content width:** Full-page routes under `app/(app)/` wrap primary content in **`max-w-[1700px] mx-auto w-full`** inside the page shell (`p-8` / flex height); height-filling pages add **`flex-1 min-h-0`** on that inner wrapper. See `docs/06-UI-Design-System.md` §2.2. `@modal` routes use `ModalShell` only. Appointments calendar: `p-8` on `appointments/dashboard/page.tsx` only — not on `AppointmentCalendarClient` root.
- **`<DataTable />`** for all list views — always server-side pagination/filtering
- **`<StatusBadge />`** for all status, type, and ID indicators — no inline badge styles
- **Forms** always use React Hook Form + a Zod schema from `lib/validators/`
- **Toasts** via Sonner only
- **URL state** via `nuqs`
- Do not modify anything in `components/ui/`
- Do not install unlisted UI libraries without checking `docs/02-Tech-Stack.md`

## Documentation Sync Rule

Whenever you make a code change that affects a schema, component, enum, 
business rule, auth flow, or any other documented pattern — you MUST use 
the `sync-docs-and-skills` skill before closing the task.

This applies to every change, no matter how small. A one-line enum change 
can affect multiple skills simultaneously.

Skill location: `skills/sync-docs-and-skills/SKILL.md`

## Data Fetching Rules

- All data fetching via **Next.js Server Actions** or Route Handlers — no direct DB calls from client components
- Server-side pagination, filtering, and sorting for every list view — client never holds full datasets
- `page`, `pageSize`, `search`, `sort`, and entity filters go in URL search params (via `nuqs`) — state is shareable and refresh-safe
- Always show `<Skeleton />` rows while loading — never an empty table on initial load

---

## What's Built vs. Planned

**Built:**
- Full app shell (TopNav, SideNav, AppShell, PageHeader) with matrix navigation
- Home dashboard (metrics/overview)
- Patients dashboard with DataTable, TableFilterBar (Notion-style), TablePagination
- Appointments dashboard with Month, Week, and Day calendar views
- Medicines dashboard
- All shared components in `components/common/`
- Design system: CSS variables, typography, colour tokens fully centralised in `globals.css`
- Intercepting modal routes for detail views
- Authentication: Better-Auth integration, real `getSession()`, subdomain-aware middleware (Node runtime, shared `lib/clinic/resolve-by-subdomain`), `/api/auth/*` route handler, `/api/clinic` subdomain resolver
- Login page (`app/(auth)/login/page.tsx`) — split 50/50 layout, React Hook Form + Zod, Sonner toasts, `returnUrl` redirect
- RBAC: `ForbiddenError` + `requireRole()` in `lib/auth/rbac.ts`, enforced in all server actions
- Document upload: presigned URLs (`lib/actions/documents.ts`), shared S3 client (`lib/storage/s3-client.ts`), `DocumentCard` + `UploadDocumentDialog` on patient and appointment detail

**Not yet built (planned):**
- All Reports views

## Do Not

A final checklist — these are the most common mistakes to avoid:

- **Do not** query the database without filtering by `clinicId`
- **Do not** pass or store `clinicId` on the client — resolve it server-side from the session
- **Do not** expose raw UUIDs in URLs or the UI — show `chartId` only
- **Do not** hardcode hex colour values in any component — use CSS variables from `globals.css`
- **Do not** modify files in `components/ui/` — compose from them, don't edit them
- **Do not** install a UI library not listed in `docs/02-Tech-Stack.md`
- **Do not** build ad-hoc tables — use `<DataTable />` from `components/common/`
- **Do not** create one-off page headers — use `<PageHeader />` from `components/layout/`
- **Do not** define Zod schemas inline in components or actions — they live in `lib/validators/`
- **Do not** implement client-side filtering, sorting, or pagination — always server-side
- **Do not** rely on UI hiding alone for access control — server actions must enforce roles too
- **Do not** create intercepting modal routes at `@modal/(.)entity/[id]` — use `@modal/(.)entity/view/[id]` instead. A bare `[id]` segment matches static nav paths like `dashboard`, causing the interceptor to fire on TopNav clicks and break navigation entirely.
